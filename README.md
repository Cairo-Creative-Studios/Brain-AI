# Brain-AI
A python simulation of the human brain using modern AI models that most closely resemble each brain component

# Why?
A turing complete intelligence is our goal. Following what we know about neuroscience and mathematical simulations of certain aspects of the brain, we may one day recreate the actual functionality of the human brain in the digital realm. This project ambitiously aims to achieve this. 

# How?
