# Brain Simulation Evolution Project

## Overview

This project implements a novel approach to artificial intelligence by simulating a simplified version of the human brain's structure and evolving it using genetic algorithms. The simulation includes multiple components representing different brain structures, with interconnections that evolve over time to optimize performance on specific tasks.

## Key Features

- Modular brain structure simulation including:
  - Neocortex (Transformer model)
  - Cerebellum (Adaptive filters and Echo State Network)
  - Hippocampus (LSTM with attention mechanism)
  - Basal Ganglia (Q-Learning model)
  - Thalamus (LSTM model)
- Neuron distribution based on biological ratios
- Evolvable inter-component connection masks
- Population-based training using genetic algorithms

## Project Structure

├── brain_simulation.py    # Main simulation class and component models
├── evolution.py           # Evolutionary algorithm implementation
├── evaluation.py          # Placeholder for evaluation functions
└── main.py                # Example usage and main execution
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-simulation-evolution.git
   cd brain-simulation-evolution
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the simulation with default parameters:

```python
python main.py
```

To customize the simulation, you can modify the parameters in `main.py`:

```python
population_size = 100
total_neurons = 100000
complexity = 5
input_size = 100
output_size = 10

initial_population = create_population(population_size, total_neurons, complexity, input_size, output_size)
evolved_population = evolve_population(initial_population, example_evaluation_function)
```

## Customization

- Implement your own evaluation function in `evaluation.py` to test the brain on specific tasks.
- Adjust the evolutionary parameters in `evolution.py` to optimize the learning process.
- Modify the brain components in `brain_simulation.py` to experiment with different neural network architectures.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the simulation, add new features, or optimize the code are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for discussion.
